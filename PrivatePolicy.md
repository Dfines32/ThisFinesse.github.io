📜 Privacy Policy
This project, Pinterest Affiliate Poster Bot, is an automation tool that uses the official Pinterest API to publish affiliate links (such as Amazon product URLs) to boards owned by the authenticated user.

🔐 Data Collection and Use
This bot does not collect or store any user data beyond what is required by the Pinterest API to authenticate requests.

The only data used is:

Pinterest access tokens

Board IDs and metadata

Link, title, image, and description content you provide for your pins

All API tokens or credentials are stored locally on the user's machine or in secure environment variables and are never transmitted or shared with third parties.

🚫 No Data Sharing
This bot does not share, sell, or transmit any data to external services or analytics platforms.

🔒 Security
The developer of this bot recommends keeping your access token and Pinterest credentials stored securely using environment variables (.env files or secrets managers). Do not commit sensitive data to public repositories.

🧰 Developer Use Only
This bot is intended for personal or developer use only. If you plan to modify or distribute this tool in a commercial or multi-user context, you must provide your own privacy policy and follow Pinterest’s and Amazon’s terms of service.
